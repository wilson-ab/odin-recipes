    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>All-purpose flour (3 cups)</li>
        <li>White sugar (3 tablespoons)</li>
        <li>Baking powder (3 teaspoons)</li>
        <li>Baking soda (1 1/2 teaspoons)</li>
        <li>Salt (3/4 teaspoon)</li>
        <li>Buttermilk (3 cups)</li>
        <li>Whole milk (1/2 cup)</li>
        <li>Eggs (3)</li>
        <li>Butter (1/3 cup, melted)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, beat together buttermilk, milk, eggs and melted butter. Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. You can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready!
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or fork to mix until it's just blended together. The batter will be a little lumpy which is what you want.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour or scoop the batter onto the preheated griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes; flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
        </li>
    </ol>
