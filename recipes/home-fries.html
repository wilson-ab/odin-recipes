    <h3>Description</h3>

    These home fries turn out crispy every time. They're great for breakfast or as a side dish. If you prefer crispy hash browns, use shredded potatoes (instead of cubed) and follow the recipe directions.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>3 medium russet potatoes, cubed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter or margarine</li>
        <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Rinse potato cubes with cold water and drain well.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Place potatoes in the skillet and season with salt and pepper; mix well. Cover and cook for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the lid and cook, turning frequently, until brown and crisp on all sides, about 10 more minutes.</li>
    </ul>
